# bf-advanced-llvm
in 2023 i made my own "programming language" called fkys (not explaining its name for an obvious reason :sob:). later i deleted my github account so now the only remaining trace of fkys is [this repo](https://github.com/ognevny/fkys-rs)

in this repository im gonna try to make a just-in-time compiler for that language

# differences
there are several differences between normal bf and fkys:
- instead of `.` and `,` this language has `o` and `p`
- `e` which exits the program
- `i` and `c` to switch between output modes
- `l` sets the cell's value to 125
- `n` and `s` insert a newline and a space
- `#` allows for comments
